## 📊 What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When User Signs Up:

2. App creates user document in Firestore:
   ```
   users/{userId}
     - email: "user@example.com"
     - role: "user"
     - createdAt: timestamp
     - lastLogin: timestamp
   ```
3. User is automatically logged in
4. Avatar appears in top bar

### When User Signs In:
1. Firebase validates credentials
2. App updates lastLogin timestamp
3. Auth state updates
4. UI shows logged-in state

### When User Submits Feedback:
1. Feedback saved with userId
2. User can view in "My Feedback"
3. Admin can see and respond
4. User sees responses
