- [x] No console errors in development
- [x] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] All components properly imported
- [x] No unused imports or variables

### 2. Firebase Setup

- [ ] Firebase config in `src/lib/firebase.ts` is correct

### 3. Firestore Rules
- [ ] Rules file created: `firestore.rules`
- [ ] Rules reviewed and understood
- [ ] Ready to deploy rules

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!
```

**Verify:**
- Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
- Check that rules are updated

### Step 2: Build Application
```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ built in ~6s
dist/index.html
dist/assets/...
```

**Verify:**
- `dist/` folder created
- No build errors
- Check bundle size (should be ~1.6MB)

### Step 3: Deploy Application
```bash
# If using Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Or deploy to your hosting provider
# (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Create First Admin User

**After deployment:**

1. Open deployed app URL
2. Click "Sign In" → "Sign Up"
3. Create account with your admin email
4. Go to Firebase Console
5. Firestore Database → users collection
6. Find your user document
7. Edit: Change `role` from `"user"` to `"admin"`
8. Save changes
9. Refresh app and verify admin access
